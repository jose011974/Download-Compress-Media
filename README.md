# Python Video Downloader

It is recommended to use the yt-dlp version vs. the Youtube-DL version.

It seems that the Youtube-DL version is considered abandoned, thus the reason for the yt-dlp version existing. It is more up to date with websites and has the most features.

I did not want to get rid of the Youtube-DL version so I decided to make seperate folders for each version. They function the same, the only difference is the library used to download media from the internet.
