
# Python Video Downloader

There are 2 versions available for use:

Youtube-DL and yt-dlp

**[Youtube-DL](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)** has not recived an update since 2021, and thus is considered abandonded. If you are savy enough, you can install the development builds and have a more up to date library, with the exception that there may be unexpected behavior.

**[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)** is a fork of Youtube-DL; it has more features and is updated more frequently. This is the version I **recommend** using, and the version I will provide updates and fixes to.
