* Impliment the blessing library to create better menus
* Clean up the code if possible, maybe find better ways to execute processes
* Possibly create a Windows binary and a Linux AppImage or Package
  * As I don't expect many people to use this, I will only create a Windows x86-64 binary and a Linux AppImage & Deb Package. If there is interest in more distros I will make the packages available as I see fit.
