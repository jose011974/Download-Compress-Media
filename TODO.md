# TODO

* Fix up the Readme
* Add a message that the user must acknowledge if there are more than 10 URLs in Unsupported URLs.txt. They must acknowledge the message very 10 URL's opened to prevent the users RAM from being filled
* Impliment a better system to download MOST media if Youtube-DL is unable to find a media source.
* Impliment the blessing library to create better menus
* Clean up the code if possible, maybe find better ways to execute processes
* Possibly create a Windows binary and a Linux AppImage or Package
  * As I don't expect many people to use this, I will only create a Windows x86-64 binary and a Linux AppImage & Deb Package. If there is interest in more distros I will make the packages available as I see fit.
